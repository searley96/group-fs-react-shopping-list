# React Shopping List

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a shopping list. 
1. The header portion of the shopping list contains three input; 
    - One for the name of the item. 
    - One for the item’s quantity and one for the item’s unit.
    - And a save button which saves the item to our database and appears on our shopping list below.

2. In the shopping list portion;
    - We created a clear button that removes all items that are saved on the database.
